Technologies Used
ReactJS: For building the user interface.
TypeScript: For adding static typing and improving code quality.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
Vite: For fast development and build process.
Features
Fully responsive design, optimized for different screen sizes.
Accurate implementation of the Figma design.
Clean and modular code for scalability and maintainability.
React + TypeScript + Vite
This project uses Vite as the bundler, and React is set up with TypeScript for a better development experience.

Vite Configuration
Vite is used for fast development, providing features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience. For React, the plugin @vitejs/plugin-react is used to enable fast refresh.

ESLint Configuration
For maintaining code quality, ESLint is configured to work with TypeScript. You can expand the ESLint configuration by enabling type-aware linting rules and adding eslint-plugin-react to the configuration.

### Changes made:
1. I corrected the formatting issue with the missing command in the **Clone the Repository** section.
2. I added backticks around the code commands (e.g., `pnpm install` and `pnpm run dev`) to ensure theyâ€™re formatted properly in markdown.

This should work perfectly now! You can copy and paste this refined version into your `README
